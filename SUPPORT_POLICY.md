Java
Java will only support current LTS version distributed by debian [see here](https://wiki.debian.org/Java).

Node
Node version support is for even numbered releases (12, 14, etc) that are current, active or in LTS maintenance. For more information, [see here](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

Python
Python support is experimental, and this project does not make any guarantees about the version of python in images.
